# Q-Learning-ML-Algorithm

## This is the Q-learning based AI training model which simulates a pirate going through a maze to find a treasure.

## Majority of the started code included the game class and the maze class objetcs.

## The bulk of my work was within the Jupyter Source file where the actual machine learning algorithm was implemented.

### A lot of machine learning algorithms and concepts stem from pure computer science, and the work we do as scientists is to leverage machine learning and computation for the benefit of everyone else.

### A good way to approach any problems is to break it down into smaller pices and come up with modularized solutions that can all be used in other similar porblems.

### Ethical concerns regarding machine learning tech must be addressed, as all the work we do in this stack should be for the betterment of the end-user, uphold theur privacy and avoid any unsupervised learning.
